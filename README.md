### Linear Regression Model (Training Data)
Overview
This README file provides an overview of the process involved in fitting a linear regression model to training data. The model is trained using numpy functions for efficient computation without the need for loops.

### Linear Model Overview
The linear model is based on the following components:

> Cost Function
> Model Equations
> Matrix Form of Model Equations

### Implementation
1. Fit Linear Regression Model
Cost Function: The cost function measures the error between predicted and actual values.
Model Equations: Derivatives of the cost function are used to derive the model equations.
Matrix Form: The model equations are transformed into a matrix form for efficient computation.
2. Compute Model Parameters
Matrix Multiplication: Model parameters are computed using matrix multiplication without using for loops.
Training Data: Training data is used to compute the model parameters.
3. Run Predictions
Testing Data: Predictions are made on testing data using the computed model parameters.
Matrix Multiplication: Predictions are made using matrix multiplication for efficient computation.
4. Calculate Mean Square Error
Cost Function: Mean square error is calculated using the cost function to evaluate the performance of the model.
5. Plot Data
Training Data Plot: Scatter plot of training data along with the linear regression model.
Test Data Plot: Scatter plot of test data along with the linear regression model.
### Expected Outputs
Linear Model Matrices: Display of computed matrices for the linear regression model.
MSE of Linear: Mean square error value for the linear regression model.
Training Data Plot: Expected plot of training data with the linear regression model.
Test Data Plot: Expected plot of test data with the linear regression model.
